The article discusses the upcoming United Nations climate summit scheduled for November 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan, where a critical topic will be China's status as a developing or developed nation in the context of climate finance. This debate was highlighted in September when Wopke Hoekstra, the European Union’s climate commissioner, questioned why China, capable of advanced feats like lunar exploration, isn't contributing more financially to global climate efforts.  
   
China is the world's **second-largest economy** and the **biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions**. Despite this, it currently holds a "developing" nation status, which exempts it from contributing to the UN's annual **$100 billion** climate finance fund—a commitment made by developed countries at the **2009 Copenhagen climate summit** to be fulfilled by **2020**, but only achieved in **2022**. For perspective, the United States contributed an estimated **$9.5 billion in 2023** to this fund.  
   
As the **2025** expiration of the current climate finance target approaches, there is a push to establish a new goal. Developing nations, including China, are advocating for an increase in funding to more than **$1 trillion a year** post-2025. The United Nations estimates that the developing world requires **$500 billion annually** to implement climate plans, while some analysts suggest the need could be as high as **$1 trillion to $6 trillion**.  
   
China's argument for maintaining its developing status includes the fact that its median income remains below developed country thresholds, and it still has **hundreds of millions** living below the poverty line. However, in the international arena, many view China's advancements—such as having more steel mills and oil refineries than any other nation and an expanding nuclear arsenal—as indicators of a developed nation. In **2023**, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously voted that China should no longer be considered a developing country.  
   
Financially, China has been active in climate-related investments:  
   
- **$45 billion** allocated to poorer nations as climate finance from **2012 to 2022**, accounting for about **6%** of the total mobilized by developed economies.  
- Since **2000**, Chinese development banks have invested **$34 billion** in hydropower projects and **$8.8 billion** in nuclear power plants abroad.  
- Since the beginning of **2023**, Chinese companies have announced over **$100 billion** in overseas investments in clean energy technology.  
- Domestically, China spent **$675 billion last year** on green technology—more than double the amount spent by the next-closest nation.  
   
These investments have positioned China to potentially peak its greenhouse gas emissions more than half a decade ahead of its own targets.  
   
Despite these contributions, China prefers to channel its climate financing through bilateral and multilateral arrangements where it has more control, rather than contributing to the UN fund. This stance complicates efforts by Western nations to increase the global climate finance pool and may lead to tensions at the upcoming summit. The central concern remains whether nations will focus on these disputes or prioritize the overarching goal of committing and disbursing the necessary funds to combat climate change effectively.

Who Thinks China’s Not an Economic Powerhouse? China
One of the hottest topics at the upcoming global climate conference is whether China should still be considered “developing.”

If China can go to the moon, asked the European Union’s climate commissioner in September, why isn’t it paying more toward climate action? Wopke Hoekstra’s quip laid bare a point of contention that will loom over November’s United Nations climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan: How can the world’s second-largest economy be simultaneously “developed”—at the cutting edge of science and technology—yet still be officially classed as “developing”—allowed concessions on emissions and access to global funds?

China likes to think of itself as a hybrid superpower, a compromise description that serves its diplomatic goals. In climate finance, though, the position is untenable. If a nation is considered developed, it’s expected to pay into a $100 billion-a-year UN pot. For the US, this meant an estimated $9.5 billion in 2023. Developing nations not only have no such obligation but can also use the money to mitigate the impact of hotter summers and more frequent storms.

A key target in Baku is to agree on a post-2025 goal for climate finance. Developing nations—including China—want an enormous increase, to more than $1 trillion a year. For rich countries, already struggling to meet the current goal, it’s paramount to add more donor nations. And they’re looking to China .

US and European leaders will push for the country to join their ranks and begin paying up. But Beijing is set on defending its developing-nation status, which allows it to spend formidable amounts of money to advance global climate goals but on its own terms.

The case for classifying the economic and political powerhouse as developed is compelling. China is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. It has more steel mills and oil refineries than any other nation, an expanding nuclear weapons arsenal and, as Hoekstra noted, a major space exploration program. The US House of Representatives last year voted unanimously that China should no longer be allowed to call itself developing.

The case for China remaining, on paper, as a developing country is no less persuasive, though. Despite steady increases in recent decades, its median income still falls below the threshold for developed countries. While the glittering skylines of megacities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen are home to some of the world’s wealthiest people, the country still has hundreds of millions living below the poverty line.

But the real disagreement here isn’t economic—it’s political. Since the Cold War, China has tried to carve out an identity as a champion of the emerging world. Even as its wealth has grown, the country has continued to push back against a world order dominated by Western powers. “It’s increasingly not about the development status of China, its per capita GDP or emissions,” says Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington. “It’s really more about this deeply rooted lack of trust. Not just in global climate politics, the unfulfilled promises made by the global north, but then, on top of that, the ongoing tension between the US and China—leading to China trying to foster any opportunities to smear mud on the face of the other side.”


The climate finance debate dates to the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit. There it was agreed that developed nations, which had benefited from decades of polluting industries, should contribute $100 billion a year by 2020 to support climate action in developing nations, a goal not reached until 2022 .

With that target expiring in 2025, nations in November must come up with a new figure. The UN estimates the developing world needs $500 billion annually to enact its climate plans. Other analysts put the figure at anywhere from $1 trillion to $6 trillion. “We recognize our responsibility,” says Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s special envoy for climate. “We just think that others that also have wealth and contributed emissions historically should also do the same.”

Western nations will struggle to get China to edge toward adding to the global piggy bank. Climate diplomats who’ve spoken to their Beijing counterparts this year have said the country will not shift its position. Instead, Chinese envoys offer commitments that the country won’t draw from the fund, leaving money for poorer countries, and say it will boost its climate financing through other channels. “Instead of putting money into this big pot that it has little control over, it would rather spend the money in a way that it has a lot more say in,” says Yao Zhe, global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing.

But that leaves China to figure out a way to persuade wealthy nations to raise the funding target—without its help. To get there, Beijing may need to prove it’s paying its fair share in its own way, says Shuang Liu, China finance director at the World Resources Institute , an environmental think tank in New York.

That won’t be easy, given China’s lack of transparency and the spiderwebs of public agencies through which money can travel. Liu and her colleagues have combed public records and statements to identify pledges that meet the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s definition of climate finance, either contributions to funds or projects that meet mitigation or adaptation definitions, such as solar farms or irrigation. They calculate that China allocated poorer nations about $45 billion of funds that could be strictly defined as climate finance over the decade to 2022. That’s about 6% of the total mobilized by developed economies. On a bi- and multilateral basis, its financing was on par with the UK’s and just behind that of France, Germany, Japan and the US.

It’s true that China also invests heavily overseas in areas that aren’t traditionally considered climate finance but still play a part in the energy transition. Its development banks have spent $34 billion on hydropower projects and $8.8 billion on nuclear power plants abroad since 2000, according to research from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center. When considering the country’s developmental status, it’s hard to overlook the frequently less-than-generous terms of Chinese financing.

Then there’s the role of China’s private capital. Contemporary Amperex Technology, BYD, Longi Green Energy Technology and other companies that help the country dominate production of batteries, electric vehicles and solar panels are increasingly investing in overseas factories. Since the beginning of 2023, manufacturing investments have led the way, with Chinese companies announcing more than $100 billion in investments abroad in clean energy technology, according to Sydney-based think tank Climate Energy Finance .

China also leads the world in spending on its own energy transition, with funding for green tech rising to $675 billion last year , more than double that of the next-closest nation, according to BloombergNEF. Those investments have helped put China on the verge of peak emissions more than half a decade before its own target.

It’s possible that neither side will yield in Baku over the question of China’s status. The biggest risk, though, is that the debate overwhelms November’s talks and deflects from the far more basic need to simply pay up, however countries choose to do so. “Paying too much attention to developed countries or developing countries is a distraction,” says the World Resources Institute’s Liu. “What matters is really that there’s money being committed and that money is really spent.”
