Summary:  
   
Anti-tourist sentiments have been rising in popular destinations due to the negative impacts of mass tourism. In Barcelona, residents have participated in protests, with some firing water pistols at visitors. Similar rallies have occurred across the Balearic and Canary Islands. In Athens, locals have held funerals for their "dead neighbourhoods." Japanese authorities have erected a fence to block a popular view of Mount Fuji to deter tourist gatherings. Soon, there will be a 5 pm curfew for visitors to a historic neighbourhood in Seoul.  
   
After predictions during the COVID-19 pandemic that tourism might never return, holidaymakers are back. According to UN Tourism, trips worldwide are set to reach 1.5 billion this year, slightly more than in 2019. The US dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, is stronger than at any point in the past two decades, except for a four-month period in 2022, making international travel more appealing for Americans.  
   
European destinations are experiencing a surge in visitors. Trips to Greece, the fastest-growing market in southern Europe, increased by 20% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous year. Visitor spending in Portugal is forecasted to be 20% higher this year than in 2019. More than half of the ten fastest-growing tourist destinations are in emerging markets. In Albania and Saudi Arabia, the number of holidaymakers doubled in the first quarter of 2024 compared to five years ago. Arrivals to the Dominican Republic and Turkey have also significantly increased.  
   
Tourism contributes 3% to global GDP and accounts for 6% of cross-border trade. It employs as many people as the entire population of the United States. In 2023, the economies of Greece, Portugal, and Spain grew by 2% or more, surpassing the EU average growth of 0.4%. Approximately 20% of Albania's economy now relies on tourism, up by two percentage points from five years ago. Saudi Arabia's tourism contribution to GDP has grown by one-third in the past year.  
   
Tourism generates national income as tourists travel to consume services in the source country. They pay consumption taxes and typically use few public services. While there are surge costs like additional policing in peak seasons, there are benefits such as increased use of off-peak train services.  
   
However, the benefits of higher tax receipts are spread out, whereas the costs are concentrated. Majorca's population swells from 1 million to 1.4 million during peak periods, leading to crowded streets and higher prices. Joana Maria, an organizer of anti-tourist protests in Majorca, describes the situation as "unbearable."  
   
Economists express concerns that booming tourism can lead to a form of "Dutch disease," hindering the growth of other industries. Research by Giuseppe Di Giacomo and Benjamin Lerch indicates that growth in Italy's tourism sector from 2010 to 2019 reduced demand for education, resulting in lower university enrollment and completion rates. The tourism industry often relies on poorly paid workers with slow productivity growth.  
   
Policymakers are implementing measures to manage tourism's impact. Towns from Portimão, Portugal, to Poole, Britain, are increasing taxes on guests to ration access and fund infrastructure improvements. Greece plans to cap the number of cruise ship berths in 2025 after passenger arrivals increased by 50% last year. In high-rent cities like Barcelona and Lisbon, governments are cracking down on short-term rentals.  
   
Tourist taxes can be effective in managing visitor numbers. In the Maldives, research by Festus Fatai Adedoyin and colleagues found that each 10% increase in taxes reduced arrivals by 5.4%, affecting an industry that contributes nearly one-third of the country's GDP.  
   
In destinations with unique attractions, taxes have less impact on visitor numbers. Tourists like Nina Tavolder, who paid a nightly charge of €4–7 ($4–8) in Barcelona, are not deterred by such fees. A 2019 study by Song Haiyan and co-authors found that higher airfare levies did not reduce overall tourist spending but shifted budgets towards less expensive accommodations and meals. Jordi Valls, a deputy mayor of Barcelona, states that the flow of tourists is "unstoppable."  
   
Efforts are being made to influence tourist behavior. Venice experimented with a €5 entry fee for day-trippers this summer and is considering doubling it to encourage overnight stays. On July 1st, Japanese officials imposed a ¥2,000 ($13) congestion charge on a crowded Mount Fuji hiking trail to redirect tourists and reduce environmental impact. Copenhagen offers free meals and museum passes to tourists who participate in litter picking.  
   
Experts suggest optimizing tourism rather than discouraging it. According to Chloe Parkins of Oxford Economics, while increased tourism can raise local prices, it also boosts wages. Governments can accommodate more visitors by investing in infrastructure and adjusting planning regulations. For example, increasing housing supply in Barcelona could help stabilize rising rents. Historical examples show that tourism revenue can be invested in higher value-added sectors, as seen in Italy and more recently in Mexico.

Hotting up
What the war on tourism gets wrong
Visitors are a boon, if managed wisely
8月 01, 2024 04:21 下午 | Barcelona


COOLING OFF is easy in Barcelona. Swim in the sea, sip sangria—or just hang about looking like a holidaymaker. Recently residents have taken part in anti-tourist protests, some firing at guests with water pistols. Other rallies calling for an end to mass tourism have taken place across the Balearic and Canary Islands. And it is not just Spaniards. Locals in Athens have held funerals for their dead neighbourhoods. Authorities in Japan have put up a fence to spoil a popular view of Mount Fuji and prevent tourists gathering. Soon there will be a 5pm curfew for visitors to a historic neighbourhood in Seoul.

During the depths of the covid-19 pandemic many predicted that tourism would never return. Now, however, holidaymakers are back. According to UN Tourism, a multilateral agency, this year trips are set to nudge 1.5bn, up a tad from 2019. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, is worth more than at any point over the past two decades, barring a four-month spell in 2022—meaning that Americans are particularly keen to travel. This ought to be a gift to the cities and countries being visited. Tourists bring cash and make little use of taxpayer-funded services. Indeed, officials in central banks and finance ministries quietly welcome the inflows, even as politicians are being pushed by voters to soak tourists (with taxes) and limit arrival numbers.


Familiar spots in Europe are seeing visitor numbers soar. Trips to Greece, the fastest-growing market in southern Europe, jumped by a fifth in the first quarter of 2024, compared with the year before. Visitor spending in Portugal is forecast to be 20% higher this year than in 2019. To find even more impressive growth one must venture to developing countries, and plenty do. More than half of the ten fastest-growing destinations are in emerging markets, where guests can get more bang for their buck and tourist industries are being created from scratch. The number of holidaymakers in Albania and Saudi Arabia doubled in the first quarter of 2024, for instance, compared with five years ago. Arrivals to the Dominican Republic and Turkey have also shot up.

Tourism accounts for 3% of global GDP, a chunky 6% of cross-border trade and employs as many people as live in America—meaning its expansion will reshape economic activity and ease government budgets. The economies of Greece, Portugal and Spain all grew at a rate of 2% or higher last year, against an average of 0.4% across the EU. Taking the broadest possible definition, some 20% of Albania’s economy now relies on tourists, up by two percentage points from five years ago. In Saudi Arabia tourism’s contribution to GDP has grown by a third in the past year. Holidays are a serious business.

Tourism, like any export, generates national income. Unlike consumers of other exports, tourists travel to the source country to consume products, rather than the other way round. Goods and services that are not normally tradeable, such as a paella by the beach, become so. In most places, foreign diners will pay consumption taxes while using few public services—unless, that is, the prawns turn out to have been dodgy. Although there are surge costs, such as requiring additional police in the summer, there are also surge benefits, such as tourists paying for train tickets during off-peak times, when carriages might otherwise be empty.

The problem is that higher tax receipts offer diffuse benefits, whereas the costs of tourism are concentrated. In Barcelona residents are annoyed by crowds, dirty streets and higher prices, as well as stores selling cannabis and tacky souvenirs. Majorca’s situation is “unbearable”, says Joana Maria, who organises local anti-tourist protests. The population of the island can swell from 1m to 1.4m in peak periods.

Hit the road
Some economists also worry. As tourism booms, it draws in a larger share of an economy’s capital and labour. Critics liken this to a kind of “Dutch disease”, where rapid growth in one export sector prevents other, higher-value-added industries from growing. According to Giuseppe Di Giacomo at the University of Lugano and Benjamin Lerch of the Swiss finance ministry, growth in Italy’s tourism business from 2010 to 2019 reduced demand for education, resulting in lower university enrolment and completion rates. Serving pizzas to hungry tourists seems a great way to get by at the age of 20; by the age of 40 a tiring waiter may wish he had studied for that degree. The holiday sector relies on lots of poorly paid workers whose productivity grows only slowly—meaning it would be a particularly bad business for developing countries to get stuck in.

Policymakers want to turn the boom to their benefit and keep locals happy. From Portimão, a lovely beachside spot in Portugal, to Poole, which also has a beach and is in Britain, towns across Europe are making guests pay more in taxes, so as to ration access and improve infrastructure. Some would like to attract richer guests; others are attempting to reduce visitor numbers altogether. Cruise-ship passengers are often particularly unwelcome since they crowd streets without having the decency to pay for hotels or restaurants. Greece plans to cap the number of berths in 2025, after passenger arrivals increased by 50% last year. Where rents are high, as in Barcelona and Lisbon, governments are cracking down on short-term lets.

In some places, tourist taxes are effective. Gangbusters growth in emerging markets is in part a result of travellers looking for a bargain. These destinations tend not to have museums stocked with the world’s loot or unique Broadway shows; instead, they often attract visitors with offerings that are more easily substituted, namely beaches and booze. Festus Fatai Adedoyin of Bournemouth University and co-authors find that in one such spot, the Maldives, each 10% increase in taxes reduces arrivals by 5.4%, but this hurts an industry that contributes almost a third of GDP.

By contrast, in places with unique attractions, taxes are less likely to put off tourists. Amid a throng of visitors outside a home designed by Antoni Gaudí, a famous Catalan architect, Nina Tavolder, a Canadian, says she was undeterred by the €4-7 ($4-8) nightly charge. She chose Barcelona for its culture, food and nightlife: “We would not consider not coming because of the tax.” A study in 2019 by Song Haiyan of Hong Kong Polytechnic University and co-authors found that higher airfare levies, a type of tourist tax, did not affect overall spending, merely shifting budgets. Those paying more for flights then splashed less on hotels and meals. As Jordi Valls, one of Barcelona’s deputy mayors, puts it, the flow of tourists is “unstoppable”.

Although tourists are unlikely to stop visiting because of a price rise, they may change how they visit. Venice has experimented with a €5 entry charge for day-trippers this summer, which it is considering doubling, in the hope of encouraging visitors to stay the night. Japanese officials, meanwhile, levied a ¥2,000 ($13) congestion charge on a crowded hiking trail at Mount Fuji on July 1st in an attempt to shift tourists to other routes and ease the environmental burden. Copenhagen is offering free meals and museum passes to tourists who do some litter picking.

It is worth trying to make tourism work, rather than to become as unwelcoming as possible. If guests raise local prices, they will also raise wages, notes Chloe Parkins of Oxford Economics, a consultancy. Governments can do more to accommodate arrivals, both by building infrastructure and loosening planning rules. Rents would not rise as fast in Barcelona, for instance, if housing supply responded to foreign and local demand. Indeed, history shows that tourism receipts can be invested in infrastructure and higher value-added sectors, as has happened in Italy and, more recently, Mexico. In most cases, summer holidays can be enjoyed by everyone. ■
